Hi. My name is Kurtis Gilliat. I am a fifth-year PhD student in economics at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). My research interests are in labor economics and political economy, with a special interest in social networks and peer effects. In two current projects, I use quasi-experimental variation in the composition of church congregations to study how peer groups influence individual outcomes (in one project I study peer effects on political behavior and in the other I look at peer effects on entrepreneurial activity). 

Prior to coming to UCSD, I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Center for the Economics of Human Development. 

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Mathematics from Brigham Young University.
