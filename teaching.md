## Undergraduate Research Lab
In addition to my work as a teaching assistant, I co-founded and lead the [Undergraduate-Graduate Economic Research Lab](https://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/resources/undergraduate-graduate-research-lab/index.html) at UC San Diego. The lab connects motivated undergraduates with graduate students working on active research projects. The goal is to give undergraduates early, meaningful exposure to academic research while helping graduate students get support on data cleaning, literature reviews, and preliminary analysis.

Since its launch in 2023, the lab has:

+ Paired hundreds of undergraduates with graduate mentors
+ Helped students develop technical skills in Python, Stata, and R
+ Created a pathway for students to pursue honors theses, pre-doctoral positions, and PhD programs

Many participating students have gone on to pursue graduate training or research assistant roles at leading institutions.
